# Rocket-Notes-Back-End

this repository was made as an exercise from the rocket seat explorer course. In this repository i use node.js , express, sqlite, knex and other technologies. 
This back end service receives http requests in the JSON format and answers those request with data. The server also edits data in its database based on the request.
This back end service is meant to be used in a notes application, where you can make notes and rate movies at your leisure.
